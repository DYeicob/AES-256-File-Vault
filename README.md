# AES-256-File-Vault
AES-256 File Vault is a high-security local encryption tool built in Python. It implements industry-standard AES-256 (CFB mode) and PBKDF2 key derivation to ensure maximum data confidentiality. Designed with a Zero-Knowledge architecture, it guarantees that only the password holder can access the encrypted files.
